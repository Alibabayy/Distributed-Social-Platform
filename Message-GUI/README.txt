I extend the protocol file

and write the ds_messenger module 
to send message when call send function
retrive all messages when call all function
retrive new messages when call new messages

For the GUI part, I finish most part of GUI command
But my program may not be able to automatically retrieve new messages while the program runs
Selecting a new contact in the treeview should display any recent messages with that contact in the message window, including the new messages.
